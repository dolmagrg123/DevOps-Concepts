# Cloud Management:

Cloud management is the process of monitoring and maximizing efficiency in the use of one or more private or public clouds. Organizations typically use a cloud management platform to manage cloud usage. Cloud management allows IT managers to move workloads through different clouds and manage the cost of cloud resources. 

Cloud management platforms might manage data, content, applications, or all three in the cloud.

## How does cloud management work?   

Cloud management software can gather the information necessary for an informed decision about what to keep in a private cloud and what to move to a public cloud, and it can monitor the results of that decision to optimize hybrid cloud and multi-cloud management. Many businesses develop their own in-house tools for private or hybrid cloud management. 

## What should a cloud management platform do?  

A good cloud management platform should allow the user to see how and when each part of the cloud infrastructure is being used and help the user make decisions about where to run workloads.

## WHAT IS CLOUD TRANSFORMATION

Cloud transformation is about making data easily visible, usable and accessible to data workers for data analysis and data science, creating a shared data intellect that will drive an increase profitability and revenue.

Cloud transformation involves:

* Migration of data from legacy systems to reduce costs or leverage the benefits of a cloud or hybrid cloud environment, while minimizing the disruption to business users that migration can cause.
* Making data from all sources accessible, even in circumstances where data platforms are disparate, with some less performant and not scalable.
* Preserving the security and governance rules enterprises have set for unique individuals, data platforms, databases, etc.
* Allowing users to keep using their preferred business intelligence (BI) tools with uniform performance and equivalent results.
