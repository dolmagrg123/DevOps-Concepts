# Cloud Management:

Cloud management is the process of monitoring and maximizing efficiency in the use of one or more private or public clouds. Organizations typically use a cloud management platform to manage cloud usage. Cloud management allows IT managers to move workloads through different clouds and manage the cost of cloud resources. 

Cloud management platforms might manage data, content, applications, or all three in the cloud.

## How does cloud management work?   

Cloud management software can gather the information necessary for an informed decision about what to keep in a private cloud and what to move to a public cloud, and it can monitor the results of that decision to optimize hybrid cloud and multi-cloud management. Many businesses develop their own in-house tools for private or hybrid cloud management. 

## What should a cloud management platform do?  

A good cloud management platform should allow the user to see how and when each part of the cloud infrastructure is being used and help the user make decisions about where to run workloads.

# Cloud Formation

## What is cloud formation?

AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to model a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code. A CloudFormation template describes your desired resources and their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack. You can use a template to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, as often as you need to, instead of managing resources individually. You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions.

## Challenges without Cloud Formation

* Manage infrastructure is challenging
* Challenging version control and keeping track of changes
* Hard to replicate stacks entire production stack for multiple development and testing purpose



#### Create and manage your infrastructure and application in a controlled and predicatable way
#### Provision and manage resources based on templates you create (json file).
#### Upload template to cloud formation

* Update anytime by uploading modified template
* Version control you infrastructure
* Replicating infrastructure is very simple
* from single ec2 resource or multi resources

# Why Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows developers to codify infrastructure in a way that makes provisioning automated, faster, and repeatable. It’s a key component of Agile and DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

### Infrastructure as code can help with the following:

* Improve speed: Automation is faster than manually navigating an interface when you need to deploy and/or connect resources.
* Improve reliability: If your infrastructure is large, it becomes easy to misconfigure a resource or provision services in the wrong order. With IaC, the resources are always provisioned and configured exactly as declared.
* Prevent configuration drift: Configuration drift occurs when the configuration that provisioned your environment no longer matches the actual environment. (See ‘Immutable infrastructure’ below.)
* Support experimentation, testing, and optimization: Because Infrastructure as Code makes provisioning new infrastructure so much faster and easier, you can make and test experimental changes without investing lots of time and resources; and if you like the results, you can quickly scale up the new infrastructure for production.

# Cloud Transformation

## WHAT IS CLOUD TRANSFORMATION

Cloud transformation is about making data easily visible, usable and accessible to data workers for data analysis and data science, creating a shared data intellect that will drive an increase profitability and revenue.

Cloud transformation involves:

* Migration of data from legacy systems to reduce costs or leverage the benefits of a cloud or hybrid cloud environment, while minimizing the disruption to business users that migration can cause.
* Making data from all sources accessible, even in circumstances where data platforms are disparate, with some less performant and not scalable.
* Preserving the security and governance rules enterprises have set for unique individuals, data platforms, databases, etc.
* Allowing users to keep using their preferred business intelligence (BI) tools with uniform performance and equivalent results.
