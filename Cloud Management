Cloud management is the process of monitoring and maximizing efficiency in the use of one or more private
 or public clouds. Organizations typically use a cloud management platform to manage cloud usage.
  Cloud management allows IT managers to move workloads through different clouds and manage the cost of 
  cloud resources.
