## Software Delivery Cycle
The Software Development Life Cycle is a process that ensures good software is built. Each phase in the life cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase. It involves all tasks involved in planning, creating, testing and deplaoying a Software Product. 

- Purpose:

SDLC process leads to the development of the software in a systematic and disciplined manner.
SDLC helps to deliver a high quality product according to the needs and demands of the customer.

- SDLC Phases

Given below are the various phases:

1. Requirement gathering and analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation or coding
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

There are typically 5 phases starting with the analysis and requirements gathering and ending with the implementation. 
 
 1. Requirements Gathering/Analysis

 This is the planning stage. The project manager and the client decide all the requirements of the project. This stage is where all the relevant information is collected to develop a product that satisfies the needs of the customer. Understanding the purpose of the product is important to find out the next steps of the product.

 2. Design

 Once all the requirements are gathered in the previous steps, the next step will be to derive a software architecture that is used for implementing system development.
 
 3. Implementation

 The design of the software is used to write code to implement into the software.

4. Testing

Once the coding is completed, we need to test the code in this stage. If any errors are found, the devlopers try to fix them. After continous testing and fixing, a product is finally derived that fulfills the needs and demands of the customer.

5. Deployment

The tested product that is ready is now deployed in this stage.

6. Maintenance

Finally, when the desired product is delivered, the developers work on continous maintenance of the product if any issues come.

## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development(TDD) is a software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In this approach before writing the actual code, test cases are created for each function. 
Test-Driven development is a process of developing and running automated test before actual development of the application. Hence, TDD sometimes also called as Test First Development.

- How to perform TDD Test

- Following steps define how to perform TDD test,

1. Add a test.
2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
3. Write some code.
4. Run tests and Refactor code.
5. Repeat.

- Benefits of TDD:

1. Much less debug time

2. Code proven to meet requirements

3. Tests become Safety Net

4. Near zero defects

5. Shorter development cycles
