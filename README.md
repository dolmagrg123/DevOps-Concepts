## Software Delivery Cycle
The Software Development Life Cycle is a process that ensures good software is built. Each phase in the life cycle has its own process and deliverables that feed into the next phase. It involves all tasks involved in planning, creating, testing and deplaoying a Software Product. 

-Purpose:
SDLC process leads to the development of the software in a systematic and disciplined manner.
SDLC helps to deliver a high quality product according to the needs and demands of the customer.

- SDLC Phases
Given below are the various phases:

1. Requirement gathering and analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation or coding
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

There are typically 5 phases starting with the analysis and requirements gathering and ending with the implementation. 
 1. Requirements Gathering/Analysis

 This is the planning stage. The project manager and the client decide all the requirements of the project. This stage is where all the relevant information is collected to develop a product that satisfies the needs of the customer. Understanding the purpose of the product is important to find out the next steps of the product.

 2. Design

 Once all the requirements are gathered in the previous steps, the next step will be to derive a software architecture that is used for implementing 

## Test Driven Development
use test cases
one of the most way develop secure application

## Continuous Integration

## Continuous Delivery

## Configuration Management

## Containerization

## Cloud Scalability, and Reliability
