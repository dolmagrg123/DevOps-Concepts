# Networking

### AWS VPC : 
It is service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

### IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):

Every machine that’s connected to a network will have an IP address. 
Currently, there are two different types of IP addresses in existence. 
The first is IPv4 and the second is IPv6. 

Every domain will be mapped to a specific IP address. 
These domains are translated to an IP address via the Domain Name System (DNS). 
The moment a user types in a domain name into their web browser, the ISP performs what’s called a DNS query. 
This will lookup the nameservers that are associated with the domain, then forward the user on to the requested site.
This might seem like a complex process, but it happens in a fraction of a second. 


There are public IP addresses, private IP addresses, static IP addresses, and dynamic IP addresses.

The difference between **dynamic** and **static** is that dynamic IP addresses change, while static IPs stay the same. 

#### What is a Public IP Address?
An ISP service provider assigns public IP addresses and operates outside of a closed network.
This is the type of IP address that a home network uses to connect with the rest of the internet’s devices.

This allows you to connect your home computer to an ISP, which then allows you to access other websites around the world, 
by communicating with the servers they’re hosted on. 

#### What is a Private IP Address?
Private IP addresses operate in a similar fashion, but instead of connecting to the internet as a whole, 
it operates on a closed private network. 

This type of IP address lets you do things like connecting your home computer to a wireless printer.
Each device will have its own unique IP address which it can be used to communicate with a home router in your private network.
