# PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS

IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) , and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) are the three most common models of cloud services, and it’s not uncommon for an organization to use all three. However, there is often confusion among the three and what’s included with each:

With IaaS, your cloud provider offers access to ‘raw’ computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, but you’re responsible for the platform and application software.
With PaaS, your provider delivers and manages the entire platform infrastructure; you are abstracted from the lower-level details of the environment, and you use the platform to develop and deploy your applications.
SaaS is software you use via the cloud, as if it were installed on your computer (and parts of it may, in fact, be installed on your computer). SaaS applications reside on the cloud network, and users can store and analyze data and collaborate on projects thorough the application.

## PaaS Platform as a Service

PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility of building and maintaining that platform on-premises.

The PaaS provider hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating system software, databases—at their data center; the customer uses it all for a for a monthly fee based on usage and can purchase more resources on-demand as needed. In this way, PaaS lets your development teams to build, test, deploy, maintain, update, and scale applications (and to innovate in response to market opportunities and threats) much more quickly and less expensively than they could if you had to build out and manage your own on-premises platform.

## Benefits

### * Faster time to market
### * Faster, easier, less-risky adoption of a wider range of resources
### * Easy, cost-effective scalability
### * Lower costs



## Use cases
There are many use cases for PaaS, including the following popular application-based ones:

* API development and management: You can use PaaS to develop, run, manage, and secure application programming interfaces (APIs) and microservices.
* Internet of Things (IoT): PaaS can support the broad range of application environments, programming languages, and tools used for IoT deployments.
* Business analytics/intelligence: PaaS tools allow you to analyze your data to find business insights that enable more informed business decisions and predictions.
