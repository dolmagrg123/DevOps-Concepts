Cloud management is the process of monitoring and maximizing efficiency in the use of one or more private or public clouds. Organizations typically use a cloud management platform to manage cloud usage. Cloud management allows IT managers to move workloads through different clouds and manage the cost of cloud resources. 

Cloud management platforms might manage data, content, applications, or all three in the cloud.

How does cloud management work?   

Cloud management software can gather the information necessary for an informed decision about what to keep in a private cloud and what to move to a public cloud, and it can monitor the results of that decision to optimize hybrid cloud and multi-cloud management. Many businesses develop their own in-house tools for private or hybrid cloud management.
